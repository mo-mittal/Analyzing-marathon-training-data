# Analyzing marathon training data

Kernel Density Estimation gives us a way to create a smooth curve given a set of data. It serves as a continuous histogram that shows us the probability of observing an event given a condition. In other words, KDE computes the conditional probability of an event. This allows use to compute and predict probabilities using machine learning techniques as we will see in this project. 

The project analyzes marathon data and creates and compares a model based on the Bayes Theorem to one that utilizes the K-NN predictor. The project later analyzes the same dataset to build regression models while seeing how controlling for different factors can improve prediction outcomes.
